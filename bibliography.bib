annote  = {This is a popular algorithms textbook which is well-cited. In particular, Part VI on graph algorithms will be of interest. Chapter 26 discusses flow networks and introduces commonly used notation. It formally describes the problem of obtaining a maximum flow and its equivalence to obtaining a minimum cut. The classical method of Ford and Fulkerson's algorithm for finding a maximum flow is described, and it includes several examples. Additional methods for obtaining a maximum flow, including the push-relabel method, are also described. The chapter notes include additional references to specific articles which may be helpful, such as those of historical interest (the article in which an algorithm was originally proposed) as well as state-of-the-art improvements (more recent articles to improve the approach).}

annote  = {This article presents a novel approach to modeling organic chemistry using category theory. The authors introduce a categorical framework that captures the structure and behavior of organic molecules and their reactions. The model allows for the representation of chemical reactions as morphisms between objects, providing a new perspective on retrosynthesis and disconnection rules. The paper includes several examples to illustrate the application of the categorical model to various organic chemistry problems. This work has potential implications for computational chemistry and the development of new algorithms for chemical synthesis planning. With a goal of this Junior IS project being to explore the intersection of computer science and chemistry, this article provides a foundational understanding of how advanced mathematical concepts can be applied to chemical problems.}

abstract = {Constraint satisfaction is becoming the paradigm of choice for solving many real-world problems. To date, most approaches to constraint satisfaction have focused on solving a problem using some form of backtrack search. Furthermore, the typical view is that a constraint satisfaction problem will be solved only once. However, in many real-world contexts, problems are solved repeatedly over time. Also such problems often exhibit some structure. This motivates the application of some form of learning to improve the performance of search from previously discovered solutions. In this paper we present an approach that uses knowledge about known solutions to a problem to improve search. The approach we present is based on a combination of decision tree learning and constraint satisfaction. We demonstrate that significant improvements, almost an order-of-magnitude, in search effort can be achieved using this hybrid approach over traditional search. We also show that the space complexity using this approach is almost negligible. This work is of interest in domains such as product configuration, and interactive constraint solving in general where the system takes the initiative by asking questions.},

annote  = {This article explores the use of decision trees to enhance the efficiency of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). The authors propose a hybrid approach that combines decision tree learning with traditional backtrack search methods. By leveraging knowledge from previously solved instances of CSPs, the method aims to reduce the search space and improve solution times. The paper presents experimental results demonstrating significant performance improvements, often achieving nearly an order-of-magnitude reduction in search effort. This approach is particularly relevant for applications such as product configuration and interactive constraint solving, where problems are solved repeatedly over time. The article provides valuable insights into how machine learning techniques can be integrated with constraint satisfaction to optimize problem-solving processes. More within current proposals for Junior IS project that is exploring building an organic chemistry tool using decision trees there is a need to understand constraint satisfaction, making this article a useful resource.}

annote  = {This article investigates the construction of decision trees that produce short and explainable rules for classification tasks. The authors propose a novel approach to building decision trees that prioritize interpretability without significantly compromising predictive accuracy. The paper introduces new metrics for evaluating the explainability of decision tree models and presents algorithms designed to optimize these metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can generate decision trees with concise rules while maintaining competitive performance compared to traditional decision tree algorithms. This work is particularly relevant in contexts where model transparency is crucial, such as in healthcare and finance. The article provides valuable insights into balancing the trade-off between model complexity and interpretability in machine learning. Given the focus on decision trees in the current Junior IS project exploring organic chemistry tools, this article offers important perspectives on creating models that are both effective and understandable.}
